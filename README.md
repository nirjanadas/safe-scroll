# 🛡️ AI Safety & Risk Auditor for Social Platforms

This project is a small simulation of an **internal Trust & Safety tool** for a social media platform.

It uses a **multi-agent LLM pipeline** on top of synthetic company data (users, posts, DMs) to:

- Analyse user posts and private messages
- Detect underage risk / misrepresentation
- Detect bullying and harassment
- Detect self-harm / mental health risk
- Detect grooming / sexual exploitation patterns
- Detect substance abuse promotion
- Map the findings to simplified **safety policies**
- Generate a **user-level safety report** with an overall risk score and recommended action

All data in this project is **synthetic** and for **research/demo purposes only**.
